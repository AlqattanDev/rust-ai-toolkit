# Rust AI Toolkit Performance Optimizations

This document describes the performance optimizations made to the Rust AI Toolkit.

## Project.rs Optimizations

1. **Project Metadata Caching**
   - Implemented a `ProjectCache` struct in `src/utils/cache.rs` to store recently accessed projects in memory
   - Projects are cached with a TTL (Time To Live) to avoid stale data
   - Directory scans are cached to reduce filesystem operations

2. **Async File Operations**
   - Added async versions of all file operations using `tokio::fs`
   - Implemented async functions like `load_project_async`, `save_project_async`, etc.
   - Parallel project loading in `collect_projects_from_directory_async` using futures

3. **List Projects Optimization**
   - Split the display logic from data retrieval in `list_projects()`
   - Created `get_all_projects()` to only retrieve necessary project information
   - Uses cached project data when available

## AI Request Handling Optimizations

1. **Configurable Max Tokens**
   - Made max_tokens configurable per request with `generate_with_options` method
   - Added default values while maintaining backward compatibility
   - Integrated max_tokens configuration into request caching

2. **Response Caching**
   - Created a `CachedAiClient` wrapper in `src/ai/cache.rs`
   - Implemented caching based on prompt and configuration parameters
   - Added global `RESPONSE_CACHE` to share cached responses across the application

3. **Streaming Response Support**
   - Added support for streaming responses from AI providers
   - Implemented `generate_streaming` and `generate_streaming_with_options` methods
   - Updated OpenAI client to properly handle streaming responses

## Rate Limiting Improvements

1. **Better Rate Limit Handling**
   - Added specific `record_rate_limit` function to handle 429 responses
   - Improved backoff strategy when rate limits are hit
   - More graceful degradation under heavy load

## General Improvements

1. **Dependency Updates**
   - Added `futures` for better async handling
   - Added `lazy_static` for singleton caches
   - Added `tokio-stream` for streaming response support

2. **Error Handling**
   - More consistent error handling throughout the codebase
   - Better error messages with remediation steps

## Next Steps

1. **Further Optimizations**
   - Consider implementing a persistent cache for AI responses
   - Add configuration options for cache TTL and size limits
   - Implement more advanced streaming options like cancellation

2. **Monitoring**
   - Add metrics collection for cache hit/miss rates
   - Implement internal diagnostics for optimization effectiveness
